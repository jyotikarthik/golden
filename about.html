                        <h1 >Our Journey</h1>
                        <b><p class="journey">This is the story of a young boy who belonged to a small village
                        near Bikaner, Rajasthan and was brought up in a joint family.
                        Despite his desire to study, he faced the burden of being the eldest
                        son, carrying numerous responsibilities. At a very young age, he
                        decided to take a risk and left his studies to migrate to the "city of
                        dreams - Mumbai," fueled by his abilities and ambitions, to explore
                        the market. Yes, this is the story of our founder, Mr. Ashok Purohit.
                        Initially, he engaged in various jobs across different fields to
                        discover his true calling.
                        Food was something he was always very passionate about. During
                        his early years, he worked jobs where he learned about methods
                        and procedures related to food. However, deep down, he nurtured
                        the constant aspiration to establish something of his own.
                        Consequently, he took yet another risk and, with his unwavering
                        devotion, curiosity, and intense hard work, he launched his first
                        business venture, "Ashok Soan Papdi Wala," in 1989.
                        His strong work ethics and effective communication skills quickly
                        grabbed attention within the market. He commenced taking
                        orders from prominent companies and consistently prioritized
                        quality. "His business philosophy revolved around prioritizing the
                        delivery of the utmost quality to his customers". Despite operating
                        on a smaller scale, he met all the quality standards of major
                        corporations, putting significant brands on notice. By this time, he
                        had cultivated numerous contacts, creating a buzz in the market
                        around the name "Ashok Seth" in the 1990s.
                        While numerous large-scale companies were involved in sweets
                        production, many faced production challenges. This is where they
                        turned to Mr. Ashok for guidance, which gave him a title of “Food
                        Consultant” in the market.
                        Despite having strong contacts, marketing skills, extensive
                        business knowledge, and a substantial labor force, he consciously
                        maintained his business on a small scale and never considered
                        expanding it until 2010. After years of serving small businesses, he
                        once again took a risk driven by his desire to accomplish
                        something more significant. This marked the establishment of
                        "Golden Food" in 2014.
                        Initial progress was promising; plans aligned, and production
                        peaked. However, as the saying goes, "The road to success is
                        paved with obstacles." In 2020, a new obstacle emerged: the
                        Coronavirus pandemic. Everything came to a standstill -
                        production and supply were suspended for over six months. Even
                        after resumption, laborers hesitated to migrate back to Mumbai.
                        Consequently, immense losses were incurred, and the prospect of
                        reopening the factory remained uncertain.
                        At that moment, he realized that if he failed to take a risk today, he
                        would regret it for the rest of his life. He decided to shift the
                        manufacturing plant to Rajasthan and start over. Mr. Ashok and his
                        son Mr. Deepak have put in a lot of blood, sweat, and tears to
                        rebuild this firm and came through with flying colors.
                        Today, Golden Food not only serves its products to Rajasthan and
                        Mumbai but has expanded its reach across India and even foreign
                        countries.Hardwork and dedication always pays off.
                        The journey of "Ashok soan papdi wala" to "Ashok seth" was not as
                        easy as it appears, but this is only the beginning, the beginning of
                        a new age, a new chapter in Golden Food's success.</p></b>
